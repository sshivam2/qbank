The theory connects depressive phenomena to the experience of uncontrollable events. It was proposed by Martin Seligman. Another good example of this can be a situation of domestic abuse where women tend to leave several times before doing so for good. A person may believe that they can never escape the abuser, even when help and support are available. Option B: The theory of psychosocial development was proposed by Erik Erikson. There are 8 stages of psychosocial development. He states that there are critical time periods, each of which poses a particular psychosocial conflict to the individual. The resolution of this conflict results in either psychosocial growth or regression. Option C: Psychodynamic theory of development explains personality in terms of the interaction between the conscious and unconscious forces of Id, ego, and super-ego. Option D: Social learning theory is a theory of learning process and social behavior which proposes that new behaviors can be acquired by observing and imitating others.</div><div class=\"telegram-link\"><small><a href=\"http://t.me/Friendly_neighborhood_medico_bot\"> </a></small></div>",
